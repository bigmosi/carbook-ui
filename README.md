# Carbook UI

This project is made for the reservation of cars. If you're preparing for a special day/event and you want a cool car for it this website is the best place for you. If you have a car and want to make some extra money from it, you can add that to our website and others will be able to reserve it! 

Main features of this website are:
 - Users can see details of all the cars.
 - Users can reserve a car for a special day (a car that hasn't been reserved yet).
 - Users can add their own cars and remove them if they want to.
